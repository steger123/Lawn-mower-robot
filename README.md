## As of now (June 2020) we are on the beginning of the Project.

The aim is to design a lawnmower robot based on design proposals.
As the first step various concept proposals are required from the team.
So we can decide together the main parameters. As the project progressing and evolving **You can learn more and more**,
**and of course, have the designs and codes on free.**
As a starter, it will be "just" a lawnmower, but later can be bigger (tractor, harvester, etc.)

## Name of the robot:
# Golem
(It can be changed ! Please propose better :-)

## Transmission:
Size: max. 200x100 mm. Weight: max. 1 kg/pc
How to solve the PRM reduction ?
A.  Gear box with timing sprockets and belt ?
B.  Worm gearbox ?
C.  Spur gearbox ?
D.  Bevel gearbox ?
E.  Cycloid gearbox ?

## Electronic:
1.  Jetson Nano
2.  Motor controller
2.  Raspberry pi v2 Camera or better
3.  Route planning: GPS and real kinematics

## Communication:
1. Between the robot and PC: GSM/serial port
2. Accuatre (10cm) positioning requried: RTK, GNSS/GPS/NTRIP

## Softwares:
1. On the robot [Called: Golem]: Python with TensorFlow Light, PyTorch
The software have to ensure object recognition, obstacle avoidance and route following.
3. Mission palanning and controlling PC [Called: Robot Rover Planner]: JavaScript & p5.serialserver
