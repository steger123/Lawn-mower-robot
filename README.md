## As of now (June 2020) we are on the beginning of the Project.

The aim is to design a lawnmower robot based on design proposals.
As the first step various concept proposals are required from the team.

## Name of the robot:
# Golem
(Can be changed ! Please proposing better :-)

## Robot logo:

(Can be changed ! Please proposing better :-)

## Body:
Max size 600x400 mm. Weight: max. 20 kg.
1. What the shape, layout looks like?

## Driven Wheels:
Size: 8-13 inch. Weight: max. 1000 g/pc
1.	How many wheels required ?

## Not driven wheels:
Size: 8-13 inch. Weight: max. 500 g/pc
1.	How many wheels required ?
2.	Caster wheel or fixed ?

## Engine/motor:
Weight: max. 1000 g/pc

## Transmission:
Size: max. 200x100 mm. Weight: max. 1 kg/pc
How to solve the PRM reduction ?
A.  Gear box with timing sprockets and belt ?
B.  Worm gearbox ?
C.  Spur gearbox ?
D.  Bevel gearbox ?
E.  Cycloid gearbox ?

## Electronic:
1.  Jetson Nano
2.  Motor controller
2.  Raspberry pi v2 Camera or better
3.  Route planning: GPS and real kinematics

## Communication:
1. Between the robot and PC: GSM/serial port
2. Accuatre (10cm) positioning requried: RTK, GNSS/GPS/NTRIP

## Softwares:
1. On the robot [Called: Golem]: Python with TensorFlow Light, PyTorch
The software have to ensure object recognition, obstacle avoidance and route following.
3. Mission palanning and controlling PC [Called: Robot Rover Planner]: JavaScript & p5.serialserver
